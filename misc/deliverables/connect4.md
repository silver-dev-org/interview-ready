Connect4 is a game where two players take turns placing a token on columns that drop to the bottom.
When a player forms 4 of his tokens in a line - horizontally, vertically,or diagonally - the player wins.

Your solution should receive an array of columns to play, like this: `Connect4([0, 1, 2, 2, 3])` and return a winning player (1,2) or 0.
