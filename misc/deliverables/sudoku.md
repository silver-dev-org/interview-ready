Build a simple mobile Sudoku app screen.

- Display a 9×9 grid where users can tap a cell to enter numbers 1–9
- Initialize the board with "m" fixed plays, allow plays in empty slots
- Highlight the selected cell, its row, its column, and its containing box
- Include basic validation feedback (e.g., red for duplicates).
- Detect valid/invalid plays
- Detect completed board
- Bonus: elegir dificultad reduciendo "m"

Focus on clean UI, layout responsiveness, and smooth interactions — automated solving logic is not required.
